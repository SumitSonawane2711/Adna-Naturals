## **Why Indian Winters 2025 Demand Special Baby Skincare** 

North India sees temperatures drop to 5 - 10°C, with humidity as low as 30%. This harsh combo: 

* ● Reduces baby skin’s natural oil barrier 
* ● Increases transepidermal water loss (TEWL) by up to 25% 
* ● Triggers dryness, cradle cap, and diaper-area irritation

*“In winter, baby skin loses moisture 2x faster than in summer,”* says Dr. Priya Sharma, Ayurvedic Pediatric Consultant, Delhi. 

That’s why **Ayurvedic baby skincare** rooted in dosha balance and herbal potency is surging in popularity across India. And at the heart of it? **Shea butter**.
