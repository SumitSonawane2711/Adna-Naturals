# **Sensitive Skin Care: How Shea Butter Protects Your Baby Naturally**

Baby skin is soft, delicate, and highly sensitive. Parents often worry about rashes, dryness, or irritation that come with changing weather, pollution, and even harsh products.

  This is why choosing the right baby lotion or moisturizer is critical.
