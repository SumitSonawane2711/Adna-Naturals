## **How to Use ADNA Naturals Baby Herbal Relief Balm**

Follow these simple steps every time your baby takes a small tumble or experiences minor discomfort:

1. **Clean the Area Gently**
   &#x20;Use a soft wet cloth or cotton pad to wipe the affected area. Avoid rubbing just a gentle dab to remove dirt or dust.
2. **Take a Pea-Sized Amount of Balm**
   &#x20;A little goes a long way. Scoop a small amount with clean fingers.
3. **Apply a Thin, Even Layer**
   &#x20;Massage the balm softly in circular motions until it’s absorbed. Its herbal ingredients will begin soothing pain instantly.
4. **Let It Work Naturally**
   &#x20;Do not cover the area unless needed. The balm forms a protective, breathable layer that allows herbs to work deep into the skin.
5. **Repeat 2–3 Times a Day**
   &#x20;For best results, reapply the balm every few hours until the discomfort fades away completely.

This routine works wonders for **bruises, minor falls, insect bites, and light sprains.**

## **The Power of Ayurveda for Baby Skin**

Ayurveda has long believed that healing begins with balance and babies, being most sensitive to their environment, deserve this balance the most.

**Manjishtha**, often called the “**queen of herbs for skin**,” helps restore skin tone and blood flow. **Raktachandan** cools irritation, while **Pudina and Nilgiri** provide instant comfort through gentle cooling.

This synergy reflects centuries of Indian herbal wisdom, modernized by ADNA Naturals through clinical testing and dermatological safety standards.

It’s not about treating pain with chemicals, it's about helping the body recover *naturally.*

## **Why Pediatricians Recommend Herbal Alternatives**

Pediatricians today are more cautious than ever when it comes to baby skincare. The reason is simple: a baby’s skin is **30% thinner and more sensitive** than an adult’s, making it prone to irritation.

That’s why doctors prefer herbal formulations like [<u>**ADNA Naturals Baby Herbal Relief Balm**</u>](https://adnanaturals.com/about) which contain no harmful preservatives, dyes, or silicones. The formula is gentle yet effective, ensuring a pain-free, worry-free healing experience.

In pediatric testing, the balm has shown zero irritation or allergic reactions, a remarkable feat considering how sensitive baby skin can be.
